# Spotify Clone

This is a Spotify Clone, it was created using Next.js, Supabase, toast, tailwind, typescript, zustand, and stripe.
The Frontend is using React Components, and the navigation of the pages is done with Next's new navigation feature, using the routes created in the folders/file structure.
The Database is postgres on supabase, with next/server working as middleware.
Stripe is used as for the subscriptions in the application.
Toast is used for notifying the users of any errors that may occur and successes.
I use Spotify on a daily basis and tried to make a simple clone that mimics the ui and basic functions of Spotify.

## Main Features

- Working Player (Pause, Play, Skip, Previous and Mute functions)
- Upload Songs with Album Art

- Search by Song Title

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
